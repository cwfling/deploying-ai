       "\"In the esteemed treatise 'Managing Oneself,' esteemed scholar Peter F. Drucker expounds upon the imperative for individuals, particularly those engaged in the knowledge economy, to possess a profound understanding of oneself. This encompasses recognising one's strengths, values, and optimal modes of performance. The treatise delineates that traditional career management by companies has waned, requiring individuals to assume the role of their own chief executive officers. Drucker elucidates the historical precedent of self-management among figures of great renown and argues its necessity even among the modestly endowed in contemporary times due to the lengthy span of work life. He propounds that strengths are to be discerned through rigorous feedback analysis, a discipline attributed to historical luminaries such as John Calvin and Ignatius of Loyola. Moreover, the article advises focusing upon one's strengths rather than striving to ameliorate weaknesses to mere mediocrity. Further contemplation is devoted to matters of individual performance, often determined by whether one is a reader or listener, and how one learns most effectively. An understanding of these personal attributes allows individuals to navigate their careers wisely, choosing roles and tasks that align with their innate capabilities and values. Drucker stresses the criticality of aligning one's personal values with those of their organization, for incompatibility breeds frustration and inefficacy. The discourse advises on the necessity of taking responsibility for relationships within professional settings, advocating for clear communication and understanding of others’ strengths and methods. Finally, it speaks to the notion of embarking on a second career or parallel endeavors as a means to sustain personal growth and fulfillment post the apex of one's primary career.\""

There was some small issue with abrupt tone changing and inputting a prompt to try to avoid abrupt transitions was able to improve the score and remove the abruptness from being detected. There was a big issue of getting the summarization score to work well. It was giving a consistent 0 score for the summary both before and after the changes. Reading the article and summary provided by the model seemed to be rreasonable but the model thought otherwise. The model thought that the summary had mentioned things that were not present in the article like mentioning of some historical figures like Napoleon, da Vinci, and Mozart but they were in fact mentioned, albeit not the main focus of the article. Some things that I tried were changing the scraped pages to remove the excess such as the title pages and further reading sections, testing out the removal of \\n, and altering the temperature to give more creativity. None of those worked so it might be possible that giving an example for context might be more helpful but it seemed like it would subvert the task since it is more of a one-off than setting up summaries for future articles.
